								<h2>August 20, 2119</h2>
								<p>It has been nearly a century since the nuclear war ended life on Earth. Luckily our students survived and escaped to space. Together, we have recreated Marianopolis College as an intergalactic space cegep that houses and teaches over 2000 space cadets. We have many laboratories conducting studies pertaining to Earth's new mutant species and their lifestyle. We wish to rid the Earth of its radioactive impurities and restore life.  Our research conducted throughout the past century has lead us to believe that we can accomplish our mission.</p>

								<h2>September 15, 2119</h2>
								<p>Big news ! Cadet Sally and Aidan have detected movement in zone 3 for the first time in 20 years. This is exciting news for us here at USS Enterprise.There is no question about it, we will have to go and explore, the only thing I am concerned about is what exactly is moving on Earth, there has been no life down there since the war of 2021. It could be anything. Dangerous or not, we have to go. I will need a team and a space pod. </p>

							</div>
							<div id="day2" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>September 30, 2119</h2>
								<p>Today we begin interviewing cadets who are interested in going to Earth to conduct the firsthand research. We are looking for cadets with the ability to build a space pod and a robot in case of contact with dangers that humans cannot undergo. We need cadets who are intelligent and committed to restoring life on Earth. We have 80 applicants and have to narrow it down to the most equipped for the job. </p>

							</div>
							<div id="day3" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>October 18, 2119</h2>
								<p>Today we are having a bake sale to raise money to be able to buy supplies for the mission to Earth. We have space cakes and star-tastic chocolates available for purchase for all 2000 cadets at our intergalactic school. We raised enough money to buy uniforms for our mission to Earth.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day4" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>October 30,  2119</h2>
								<p>Cadets believe our time has come to explore the Earth.We have finally conducted enough research. It is time to leave our safe space school, travel to Earth and restore life. We will begin building the space pod and Dr. Nefario, who has been a consultant on this project for over 7 years, will be helping the cadets to make a robot that will be able to take on the role of a cadet in dangerous situations.</p>

							</div>

								<h2>November 7, 2119</h2>
								<p>We received news from squad 3 who have been researching coordinates 45.516381,-73.676074 for some time now. They have identified them as the location of the old Vanier College, this is where we will have to begin our exploration of Earth. Dr. Nefario, has briefed us on what he knows about Earth. There seems to be 3 power towers located in different parts of what used to be Montreal. Each tower controls a certain feature crucial to life on Earth. The only problem is, that all 3 towers are disabled. Tower 1 is an air filter which cleans out the toxins left behind by the war of 2021, Tower 2 eliminates radioactivity, and Tower 3 purifies polluted water. To activate the towers, we must turn on certain switches and then supply power to them through power balls. </p>

							</div>
							<div id="day6" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>November 22, 2119</h2>
								<p>Day 1. We have finally chosen our team of 16 space cadets. We will begin discussing plans for the robot and the space pod immediately. I have split the cadets into two groups of 8 to ensure our work gets done efficiently. Team A is comprised of cadets working on the commercial, website and programming of the robot and Team B is comprised of cadets working on the space pod. Both teams will work on the robot on alternating days. I am keeping this journal during our mission in case anything happens to us throughout our journey. Wish us luck!</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day7" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>December 19, 2119</h2>
								<p>Day 2. Today, the students prepared the building ground for the space pod. Commander Ferly and Cadets Eric, Jenny, Vanessa, Allyson and Sally put out plastic tarps to protect our intergalactic school. The primary walls were put up and are being held together by wooden support beams until the design is finalized. Cadets Claudia, Fozail and Vincent worked on the script for the commercial while Cadets Aidan, Fred and Daniel worked on the outline for the website. Cadet Kaitlin impressed us with her drawing skills and drew up a sample of the website design. Commander Amanda went out to buy all the supplies we will need throughout the next few weeks.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day8" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>December 20, 2119</h2>
								<p>Day 3. Today we focussed mainly on the robot ideas. Cadets Erik, Dinesh, Alex and Paul explained their ideas to the team of Cadets. The most acclaimed idea was a robot that can rise to the height of the tallest tower, and drop the power ball straight into it. It seems to be the safest idea, seeing as there is a low probability of missing the target. The only problem we have now, is deciding how to lift the ball to the tower. Cadets on Team B continued working on the frame of the space pod, and painted the first coat on the main walls.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day9" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>December 22, 2119</h2>
								<p>Day 4. Today the cadets decided on a concrete plan for the robot. They decided to make a series of conveyor belts to lift the power balls to the top of the towers. There will be an initial pickup system that brings the balls from the ground to the storage area. The bottom of the storage area will have a second conveyor belt that brings the power balls to the delivery system. The cadets are not quite sure how the delivery system will work, but the pickup system is under construction. Meanwhile, Team B was yet again working on the space pod. Cadet Jenny came up with some designs for the entrance and security seats we will use for  landing. The backbone of the website and commercial are underway and should be ready by the end of the next work day.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day10" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>December 23, 2119</h2>
								<p>Day 5. I decided, on a whim, to allow the students to choose for themselves if they wanted to work today I felt bad making them come in so close to the intergalactic holidays, especially after the stress Marianopolis final exams. I have asked Cadets Jenny and Claudia to design a uniform, over the break, for the cadets and Dr. Nefario to wear on their mission to  Earth. Cadet Aidan and Kaitlin are doing a great job on the website, it looks very nice and is coming along very well. The space pod is finally completely set up and we have the week after our holiday break to add the finishing touches. However, we still need to design a meeting area within the space pod. Cadet Claudia and Fozail have finished the script for the commercial. We will begin filming on our first day back. The cadets have found some flaws in the design of the robot. A few of them went back to the drawing board and decided that making a scissor lift to bring the storage area up to the tower would require less power and be easier to construct than a system of conveyor belts. We will prototype this new idea upon our return from the break.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day11" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>January 6, 2120</h2>
								<p>Day 6. We are back from our wonderful intergalactic holidays and the cadets are excited to be back at work! Today was our first day of filming the commercial. Although Cadet Fozail and Vincent took three hours to set up, we were able to film two scenes which explained our call to Earth. We wish to show this video to anyone and anything we find on Earth, as well as to the handful of colonies living in space. The commercial displays the great qualities of our school, the robot we are building to accompany us on our mission and of course includes the explanation of our mission. A few cadets took it upon themselves over the break to try out the scissor lift system, and have deemed it to be  impractical. I am quite worried about the robot as we have just under two weeks left to get the robot up and running to keep up with our mission plans. The design of the website pages have been completed and the only remaining component includes unveiling the information about our mission and our cadets. In addition, the space pod is being painted once again. Cadet Jenny is drawing up plans to build space chairs that provide light, in case of power loss during the trip. She has taken it upon herself to make it from scratch. </p>

							</div>
							<div id="day12" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>January 7, 2120</h2>
								<p>Day 7. Today the cadets realized we are not equipped with what is needed to machine our robot. At first, the team decided to use VEX to build the base and the lifting system. Cadets Fozail, Dinesh and Erik have now decided that they would like to use T-Slot Extrusions instead. I have left it up to them to find a workshop to use. The new design put in place to work on at Concordia uses two conveyor belts to bring the power balls to the top of the tower. Now, we have decided to shoot the power balls so we can deliver the balls from farther away. While some cadets were cutting the pieces to the right length for the base, others were making prototypes out of cardboard for the pieces of sheet metal for the hopper. Commander Amanda has just put in an order for everything we are missing for the space pod, robot and commercial. Another scene of the commercial has been filmed. The quality of the filming in incredible and the sound is especially crisp seeing as Cadet Fozail insists on setting up 7 audio recording devices every time we shoot. Cadets Jenny and Claudia have come up with an initial design for the uniform, Claudia hopes to send the final design to the textile department by tomorrow night.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day13" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>January 8, 2120</h2>
								<p>Day 8. Cadet Fozail received word overnight that the cadets can use Concordia University’s machining workshop as long as they do it safely and do not disturb the space rangers studying there. Cadet Erik also has connections with Loyola High School who will let the cadets work after hours to complete the robot. The students went to Loyola after lunch to machine the base and from what I’ve heard, have been successful so far. They will be there for much of the night so I will be notified tomorrow on the progress that has been made.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day14" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>January 9, 2120</h2>
								<p>Day 9. The uniforms have been ordered and the textile department (Quba Promotions) has finalized the design. I hope we will receive them before we depart for our mission. The space pod has been completed and the safety chairs are now being installed. Cadets Vanessa and Sally have decided to add some windows so we can see what’s around us before we leave the pod when we land on Earth. Commander Ferly and Cadet Eric have machined a 3-D version of our school logo to put on the outside of the space pod so we can be recognized by the space marshalls. Some cadets have decided to go to Concordia again today to work on the hopper, they hope to machine it out of flexible plexi glass to ensure the robot s as lightweight as possible. </p>

							</div>
							<div id="day15" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>January 10, 2120</h2>
								<p>Day 10. Today, some cadets decided to leave early and go to Loyola High to machine and finish the base. Last thing I heard was that the wheels were attached and the base was moving. Cadet Jenny has completed her very first space chair and is very excited to have it travel to Earth with us. Cadets Fred and Daniel have started programming prototypes to ensure they know exactly what to do when our robot is finished. More scenes of the commercial were filmed, although we have decided that we will actually keep filming after the commercial is released and make a documentary about our mission to Earth.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day16" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>January 12, 2120</h2>
								<p>Day 11. Today Cadets Erik, Daniel, Dinesh, Fred and Alexandra went back to Loyola to work on conveyor belts that will bring the power balls from the space pod to the hopper and then to the shooter. They are still deciding between using a VEX tank tread or a rubber piece instead, to ensure optimal lifting. Others stayed here to finish the space pod. Cadets Fred and Daniel were finally able to program the vex motors for the robot. Their next task is to learn how to program bane bot motors. We decided to have a photoshoot for the Cadets’  and their ID cards today. The pictures will be used for all mission propaganda. I left Cadet Fozail in charge of the photos, I cannot wait to see how they turn out!</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day17" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>January 13, 2120</h2>
								<p>Day 12. Today was our last day before classes start up again. The cadets were happy to have completed the space pod in time, as they were not cleared to use the student lounge to continue building during the semester. We cleaned up the student lounge and had to wash all the paint off the floor as well as the wood and metal scraps. We also received sample sizes for the team uniform from the textile department of our spaceship (Quba Promotions). We had trouble deciding what fabric we wanted, the team was completely split, however under very democratic measures we decided on the polyester cotton blend. We also filmed our last scene for the commercial/documentary today, now it is up to the editing team made of Cadet Fozail and Vincent to put it together. Tonight some cadets will return to Loyola to finish what they can, they finally decided to use rubber bands on the conveyor systems and will attempt to make them tonight. Cadet Daniel and Erik are working on the shooter and the mount for it.</p>

							</div>
							<div id="day18" class="journalPages journalVisible">
								<h2>January 17, 2120 </h2>
								<p>Day 13. Today was our last day to work on the website, video and cleaning up. Cadet Fred and Daniel decided they wanted to make a tutorial for all the other Marianopolis students as a teaching aspect. They want everyone to get something out of our expedition. We finally brought our robot back from Loyola; it looks spectacular! The Cadets just need to mount the shooter on the wood pieces that Cadet Daniel made. The website is nearly completed, only requiring the photos from the photoshoot and the link to the commercial that Cadet Fozail has been working after hours to edit. I am thinking about uploading this journal as well as I would like the other students to know how hard we worked and what we did with our time. Cadets Vanessa, Sally and Alexandra, with the help of all the cadets, are working on packing up the tools we will need for the mission. I hope this goes well, we are set to launch the 12th of February.</p>
