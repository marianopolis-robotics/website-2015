					<p id="text0" class="">Preparing for the competition was not easy. I was used to the long days and the workload from my previous robotics experiences. It was always a struggle, waking up every morning and going to school during holiday, but the difficult problems kept everyday interesting and exciting! Even though it was hard sometimes I always looked forward to coming in to get work done. I worked on the computer most of the time, overcoming bugs and struggling to meet deadlines. The team had a lot of trouble identifying a final theme, and that made everything a mess. We sorted that out eventually but it set us all back. I had to sacrifice several nights to get everything done. The team kept me up and motivated to keep going until everything was done.

					<p id="text1" class="hideText">As a first year robotics team member, I had really no idea what to expect. I was previously interested in digital graphics and arts, but I never thought it could be of any use for building a robot. Recalling the first official work day, when we were assigned different tasks, I realized that the competition had so many more components that I imagined. I really enjoyed designing the website and drawing the sketches for each and every page of it. The hardest part was balancing the heavy academic schedule with a workload of Photoshop-based tasks. I really had to give up on several nights of sleep to meet the deadlines. The team always supported me and helped me in any way possible. It truly an empowering experience.

					<p id="text2" class="hideText">During my experience on the team, I learned to rapidly work with people that I never talked to before and they taught me lots of new techniques and vocabulary which is useful for the future like painting, common tools, electrical. I loved how after a few days of work, we quickly become a coordinated team. Although, we all sacrificed a lot of the winter break and spent time after school till very late and solving all kind of problems, robotics will always be a unforgettable experience.

					<p id="text3" class="hideText">This year was very challenging for the Marianopolis Robotics Team. Being the co-captain of a team is always stressful, mostly when there are so many expectations. Our team had so many great ideas for Actimania that at times it was very hard to make decision, mostly concerning the robot design. However, we learnt to exploit the many talents of each and every one of us to reach our goals. We all gave up countless hours of sleep but in the end we do it for one reason, our common passion for robotics and our desire to excel.
